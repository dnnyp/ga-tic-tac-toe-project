## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- animate.css
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- AJAX

## Process
I tackled this project by first getting familiar with all the documentation that was provided. I knew the API was going to be a key component so I used curl scripts to help myself understand the data being communicated to and from the API. Once I was comfortable with how the API worked I began to pseudocode my game logic. I built an MVP which would allow users to log in and place moves on a game board. From there I added additional game logic piece by piece and tested each new function with console logs.

I utlized Bootstrap to build out the UI. I had never used Bootstrap before so I relied on the examples provided on their documentation page and experimented with them using codepen.io. Once I understood how modular the Bootstrap framework was I was able to get creative with combining Bootstrap components. I browsed through all the available examples to find the components that best suited my needs for each function of the game. I spent a considerable amount of time trying to make my page responsive on all devices. I fine tuned every measurement to allow the page to maintain the same level of usability and legibility across all screen sizes.

As I researched and experimented with different CSS and JavaScript tricks I went back and refactored my code to make it more friendly to both users and other developers. My goal was to avoide redundancy and to make as much use as I could from each line of code.

Finally I used animations from the animate.css library to animate certain parts of the page to lessen the abruptness of transitions. I spent a good amount of time fine tuning the timing of each animation to be aesthetically pleasing without disrupting the flow of the game.

I relied heavily on whiteboarding, rubber ducking, peer feedback, research, experimenting, and a lot of coffee.

## Unsolved Problems
I am in the process of implementing a two player option which will allow users to play against another user in near-real-time. I plan to introduce the option for users to view miniature mockups of previous games and to resume unfinished games. I would also like to implement a feature to display confetti upon a user winning.
